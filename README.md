# Starlink+
### Highlights
Starlink+ is a visualization dashboard using ReactJS and D3 to track satellites in real-time based on geo-location.
A selector was built based on location, altitude, and duration to refine satellite search.
It can animate selected satellite paths on a world map using D3 to improve the userâ€™s friendliness.
Working on the deployment of the dashboard to AWS right now.
